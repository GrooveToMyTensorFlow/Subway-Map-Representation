# Project Title: Subway Map Representation
Description:
This project consists of two main parts:

A subway map representation using a variation of the adjacency list implementation

# Subway Map Representation
The subway map is represented as a variation of the adjacency list implementation. The main data structures used in this project include:

Enum: Colour for representing the color of the subway line
Class: SubwayMap for managing the subway map and related operations
Nested Class: Node for representing a subway connection
Nested Class: Station for representing a subway station
Dictionary: S for storing subway stations

# Features:
Insert and remove stations
Insert and remove connections between stations
Find the shortest route between two stations using a breadth-first search algorithm

# Task Breakdown:
Implement the SubwayMap class and its methods
Create a subway map and test cases in a separate document
Write a main program to drive the test cases
Add inline documentation to the source code
# Usage
Compile and run the project
Follow the prompts to interact with the subway map representation
